- Rather than tailoring disconnected designs to each of an ever-increasing number of web devices, we can
treat them as facets of the same experience. We can design for an optimal viewing experience, but embed
standards-based technologies into our designs to make them not only more flexible, but more adaptive to
the media that renders them. In short, we need to practice Responsive Web Design (RWD).
- No design, fixed or fluid, scales seamlessly beyond the context for which it was originally intended.
The example design scales perfectly well as the browser window resizes, but stress points quickly appear
at lower resolutions. When viewed at viewport smaller than 800×600, the illustration behind the logo quickly
becomes cropped, navigation text can wrap in an unseemly manner, and the images along the bottom become too
compact to appear legible. And it’s not just the lower end of the resolution spectrum that’s affected: when
viewing the design on a widescreen display, the images quickly grow to unwieldy sizes, crowding out the
surrounding context.

- The CSS specification supplied us with a bevy of acceptable media types, each designed to target a specific
class of web-ready device. The CSS3 specification, improving upon the promise of media types. A media query allows
us to target not only certain device classes, but to actually inspect the physical characteristics of the device
rendering our work.

-Both em and rem are flexible, scalable units which are translated by the browser into pixel values, depending on
the font size settings in your design. If you use a value of 1em or 1rem, it could translate in the browser as anything
from 16px to 160px or any other value.
