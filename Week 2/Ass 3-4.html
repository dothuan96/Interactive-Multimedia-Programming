          <p>King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence
            of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries AD. The details of Arthur's story are
            mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern
            historians. The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae,
            the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.[3]</p>

          <p>Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of
            international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century
            Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain).[4] In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from
            before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a
            magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn.[5] How much of Geoffrey's Historia
            (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.</p>

            <p>Although the themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical
              version; Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of
              Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul. Many elements and incidents
              that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the wizard
              Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and final
              rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of
              Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from
              King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but
              waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend lives on, not
              only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.</p>

        <h4>Sir Lancelot</h4>
        <a href="#">Knight of Lake</a>
        <div class="img-bor">
          <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fategrandorder/images/9/90/LancelotS4.png/revision/latest?cb=20160725145244" alt="">

        <div class="info">
          <p>Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the Lake), alternatively also written as Launcelot and other spellings, is one
            of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the
            lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age – until his adulterous affair with Queen Guinevere is
            discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom.</p>

          <p>His first appearance as a main character is in Chrétien de Troyes' Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, written in the 12th century.
            Later, his exploits were expanded upon in the Prose Lancelot, which was further expanded upon for the Lancelot-Grail cycle. His and
            Lady Elaine's son, Galahad, also becomes a famed knight.</p>

          <p>The character Lancelot is first introduced by writer Chrétien de Troyes in the 12th century. In Chrétien's earliest known work Erec
            and Enide, the name Lancelot appears as third on a list of knights at King Arthur's court. The fact that Lancelot's name follows Gawain
            and Erec indicates the presumed importance of the knight at court, even though he did not figure prominently in Chrétien's tale. Lancelot
            reappears in Chrétien's Cligès. Here, Lancelot takes a more important role as one of the knights that Cligès must overcome in his quest.</p>

          <p>It is not until Chrétien's Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart (Le Chevalier de la Charrette), however, that Lancelot becomes the protagonist.
            In this text, he is presented as the most formidable knight at King Arthur's court. His adulterous relationship with the Queen is also introduced
            in this text. Lancelot is portrayed in Chrétien's work as the bravest of knights and one whom everyone is forced to describe as uniquely perfect.
            His deeds are recounted for their uniqueness, not only among living knights but of all men who have ever lived.[5] The problem is that critics have
            been unable to agree on how to reconcile his perfect 'saintliness' with his obvious adultery with King Arthur's wife Queen Guinevere; especially when
            it is against King Arthur, to whom all knights owe selfless respect.[1] It is also Chrétien who first gives Lancelot the name Lancelot du Lac (Lancelot
            of the Lake)[6] which was later picked up by the Anglo-French Lancelot-Grail and then Thomas Malory.[7] Lancelot's affair with Guinevere can be also seen
            as parallel to that of Tristram (or Tristan) and Iseult, with him ultimately identified with the tragedy of chance and human failing that is responsible
            for the downfall of the Round Table.</p>

        <h4>Sir Gawain</h4>
        <a href="#">Knight of Sun</a>
        <div class="img-bor">

          <p>Gawain is King Arthur's nephew and a Knight of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. Under the name Gwalchmei, he appears very early
            in the legend's development, being mentioned in some of the earliest Welsh Arthurian sources.</p>

          <p>He is one of a select number of Round Table members to be referred to as one of the greatest knights, most notably in Sir Gawain and the
            Green Knight. He is almost always portrayed as the son of Arthur's sister Morgause (or Anna) and King Lot of Orkney and Lothian, and his
            brothers are Agravain, Gaheris, Gareth, and Mordred. He was well known to be the most trustworthy friend of Sir Lancelot.[1] In some works,
            Sir Gawain has sisters as well. According to some legends, he would have been the true and rightful heir to the throne of Camelot, after the
            reign of King Arthur.[2][3]</p>

          <p>Gawain is often portrayed as a formidable, courteous, and also a compassionate warrior, fiercely loyal to his king and family. He is a friend
            to young knights, a defender of the poor, and as "the Maidens' Knight", a defender of women as well. In some works, his strength waxes and wanes
            with the sun; in the most common form of this motif, his might triples by noon, but fades as the sun sets. His knowledge of herbs makes him a great
            healer,[4] and he is credited with at least three children: Florence, Lovell, and Gingalain, the last of which is also called Libeaus Desconus or Le
            Bel Inconnu, the Fair Unknown. Gawain appears in English, French and Celtic literature as well as in Italy where he appears in the architecture of the
            north portal in the cathedral of Modena, constructed in 1184.</p>

          <p>A few references to Gawain appear outside Wales in the first half of the 12th century; for instance in his Gesta Regum Anglorum of around 1125, William
            of Malmesbury writes that "Walwen's" grave had been uncovered in Pembrokeshire during the reign of William the Conqueror; William recounts that Arthur's
            formidable nephew had been driven from his kingdom by Hengest's brother, though he continued to harry his enemies severely.[23] However, it was Geoffrey
            of Monmouth's version of Gawain in the Historia Regum Britanniae, written around 1136, that brought the character to a wider audience.[24] As in the
            Welsh tradition, Geoffrey's Gualguanus is the son of Arthur's sister, here named Anna, and her husband is Lot, the prince of Lothian and one of Arthur's
            key supporters. Gualguanus is depicted as a superior warrior and potential heir to the throne until he is tragically struck down by his traitorous brother
            Modred's forces.</p>
