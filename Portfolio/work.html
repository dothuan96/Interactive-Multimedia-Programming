                    <h4>What kind of is a good leader?​</h4>
                    <p>A good leader should have these characteristics:</p>
                    <p><strong>Self-Awareness: </strong>He has an intimate knowledge of
                      his inner emotional state. He knows his strengths and his weaknesses.
                      He knows when he’s working in flow and he knows when he’s over worked.</p>
                    <p><strong>Self-Direction: </strong>He’s able to direct himself effectively
                      and powerfully. He knows how to get things done, how to organize tasks and
                      how to avoid procrastination.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ability to motivate: </strong>Leaders don’t lead by telling people
                      what they have to do. Instead, leaders cause people to want to help them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Vision: </strong>He’s working towards a goal that’s greater than
                      himself. It could be something small, like the success of the team, or a larger
                      vision like world peace.</p>
                    <p><strong>Social Awareness: </strong>Understanding social networks and key influencers
                      in that social network is another key part of leadership. Who in the organization
                      has the most clout, both officially and unofficially? Who moves the hearts of the group?</p>

                    <h4>What kind of bosses have you had? What they did wrong and what right?​</h4>
                    <p>When I worked on a team before, I always a leader team (all of time that are in school). So, I have no
                      experience working under a boss, at least until now. Because I’m a leader, so I cannot see my mistake.
                      But if anyone point out my faults, I will listen of them and try to solve it.</p>

                    <h4>Your experiences about working in teams – what kind of is a good team?​</h4>
                    <p>A good team not only cause good leader but also depending on members. The biggest problem that
                      I always face on when working on team that members are usually not finish their work before
                      deadline even deadline is decided by all of them. </p>
                    <p>On my opinion, a good team should be lead by a good leader at first. Then, all of members
                      should finish their job. They also try to make its better or at least similar with the things
                      that are decided when team discuss.</p>
