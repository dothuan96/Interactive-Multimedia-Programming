1-2. jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements,
create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities
for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create
abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets.
The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.

3. For the earlier list person application, we can make some animation when the page load such as Fade in, Fade out, etc.
Also, we can handle the onclick event on js file and make list person display when browser finishes loading document.

4. If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN:
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.js" integrity="sha256-2Kok7MbOyxpgUVvAk/HJ2jigOSYS2auK4Pfzbm7uH60=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
